## Design Considerations

The primary application of this module is to view the custom month year picker and able to select any month available. There was no simple month year picker provided by ng-bootstrap which suited the specific usage i need for a project. So i created 1 in spare time.

## Developing

This project was developed using the NodeJS version 18 and angular 16. You may experience problems using older versions.

Once you have cloned the repository, install all packages using `npm`:

```
npm install
```
