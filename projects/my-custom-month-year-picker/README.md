## Quick start

`@my-custom-month-year-picker` is shipped via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) //TODO. You can install the package using the following command for the latest supported version of Angular:

```
npm install --save @my-custome-month-year-picker
```

## Design Considerations

The primary application of this module is to provide a custom month year picker with angular. There was not simple month year picker provided by ng-bootstrap which suited the specific usage i need for a project.

## Developing

This project was developed using the NodeJS version 18 and the library for the custom picker is using angular 13. You may experience problems using older versions.

Once you have cloned the repository, install all packages using `npm`:

```
npm install
```
